# sniperBot
This bot subscribes to Pump.Fun mints and gets the mint address for the token, immediately buys it, unsubscribes from new token creations, and then subscribes to the trade logs of the mint. The program waits until someone else sells or a predetermined total of solana is entered into the bonding curve, and then the token is then sold.
